   - Any suggested fixes (optional)

### What to Include

Please include as much information as possible:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths** of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- **Location** of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact** of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Security Best Practices

When using Dev API Vault:

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit sensitive environment variables
2. **API Keys**: Use strong, unique API keys in production
3. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production environments
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement appropriate rate limiting
5. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs on the client side
6. **Updates**: Keep dependencies and the application updated

### Vulnerability Disclosure Process

1. **Report received** → Investigation begins
2. **Vulnerability confirmed** → Fix development starts
3. **Fix ready** → Coordinate disclosure timeline
4. **Fix released** → Public disclosure and credit

### Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help keep our users safe. With your permission, we will:

- Credit you in our security advisories
- Include you in our Hall of Fame (if you wish)
- Provide a vulnerability disclosure certificate
